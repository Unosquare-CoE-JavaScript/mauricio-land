Advanced react component patterns is a good course that covers in detail what design patterns are and how to apply them to react.

the key difference here is that if you have a C# or Java background you are already familiar with the concept of design patterns but knowing how to apply this in web development with examples is important to follow a best practices structure in a codebase.

On the same level, the focus on custom hooks is also critical, to implement new features with modern react.

And finally, the focus on the inversion of control is very good to understand the patterns in more detail.

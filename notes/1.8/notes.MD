The good about this book is that it uncovers a whole area of JS that's mostly underutilized with practical examples and comparisons with other languages so that it makes it engaging

another key factor is that it teaches you how to measure/benchmark performance of your application to see if multithreading is good for X projects,
teaching you when and when not to use threads

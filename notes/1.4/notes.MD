Concurrent rendering is an excellent course for those who have been programming with React 17/hooks for quite some time but needed a more direct introduction to the new changes that React 18 proposes outside of its experimental stage when the official documentation does not offer enough information.

As someone who started using <Suspense /> the moment lazy loading was implemented in React, knowing what new things I can use is good to implement in future projects, same with transition and the new hooks

And last but not least concurrent mode is an amazing change for rendering and network speeds, solving stuttering in the UI and prioritizing/caching component rendering.

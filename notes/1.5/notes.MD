YSKJSY is a book that touches more on how things work internally from the fundamentals with javascript than just being a get started for beginners, which is better as long as you take your time with the concepts.

Get started mentions what javascript is, who is responsible for its maintenance, and how JS works in particular (in terms of programming) which only serves as an introductory book for beginners with the extra important technical concepts to know about the language.

The second chapter, Scopes and Closures, is more important because it touches in detail what is "this" and why the distinction of scopes is important to know when we want to know how is the data flow and where are present our variables, this with hoisting teaches the philosophy of object oriented programming and where are the things present inside a function.
